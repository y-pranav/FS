/*
In this assignment, you will simulate the workflow of a food delivery app that 
has the following tasks:
	- First Concurrent Activities: Fetch menu data from the server and check customer details.
	- Sequential Activities: Prepare the food and package it.
	- Second Concurrent Activities: Assign a delivery person and update the delivery status.

Each task takes different amounts of time, and some tasks can happen concurrently 
while others need to happen sequentially.

Requirements:
=============
Use async/await and promises to model the system.
	Task 1: Fetch menu data from the server should take 2 seconds.
	Task 2: Check customer details should take 1.5 seconds.
	Task 3: Prepare the food should take 3 seconds.
	Task 4: Package the food should take 2 seconds.
	Task 5: Assign a delivery person should take 1 second.
	Task 6: Update the delivery status should take 1.5 second.
Handle any errors that may occur (for example, if the delivery fails).

Hint:
-----
You will need to:
Use Promise.all() for concurrent tasks.
Use await for sequential tasks.

Expected Output:
===============
Starting process for order 123...
Fetching menu data...
Checking details for customer ID: 456...
Menu data fetched.
Details verified for customer ID: 456.
