/*Trivikram and Vamshi are friends. They need to write N screen-plays, numbered 
from 1 to N. Each screen-play requires specific number of papers to write.

Initially, Trivikram has T number of papers in his box and Vamshi has V number of 
papers in his box. They have started the screenplay writing in the following way:
    - Trivikram starts from screen-play number 1 to N and Vamshi starts from N to 1.
    - They begin writing the screen-plays at same time.
    - Each screen-play takes same amount of time, irrespective of its size.
    - Trivikram or Vamshi must write the screen-play, if they have enough number 
      of papers in their respective boxes. Otherwise, they first have to refill 
      their boxes (instantly) and then write the screen-play.
    - In case, Trivikram and Vamshi reach the same screen-play, the one with more
      number of papers currently in their box should write the screen-play. If 
      they have the same number of papers, then Trivikram should write the 
      screen-play.

You are given 1-indexed integer array screen-play[] of size N, where screen-play[i]
is the number of papers required for ith screen-play, and two integers T and V.
Your task is to return the number of times they have to refill to write all the 
screen-plays.

Constraint:
-----------
max(screen-play) < T,V < 10^9


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: 3 space separated integers, indicates N, T and V.
Line-2: N space separated integers, screen-plays[].

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer result.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
6 10 10
5 3 4 4 5 4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
2

Explanation: 
------------
- Initially, Trivikram and Vamshi have 10 papers each in their boxes.
- Trivikram writes Screen-play-1, Vamshi writes Screen-play-6.
- Trivikram and Vamshi now have 5 and 6 papers in their boxes respectively.
- Trivikram writes Screen-play-2, Vamshi writes Screen-play-5.
- Trivikram and Vamshi now have 2 and 1 papers in their boxes respectively.
- Trivikram and Vamshi do not have enough number of papers to write screen-play-3 
and screen-play-4 , so they refills their boxes and finished the screenplays.
So, the total number of times they have to refill is 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 9 7
4 5 2

Sample Output-2:
----------------
0

Explanation: 
------------
- Initially, Trivikram and Vamshi have 9 papers and 7 papers each in their boxes.
- Trivikram writes Screen-play-1, Vamshi writes Screen-play-3.
- Trivikram and Vamshi now have 5 papers each in their boxes respectively.
- Now, Trivikram writes Screen-play-2. Finished the screenplays.
So, the total number of times they have to refill is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.
