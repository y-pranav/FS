// VishnuVardan is working with Decision Trees for AI-based predictions.
// To analyze alternative outcomes, Kishore has planned to flip the decision 
// tree horizontally to simulate a reverse processing approach.

// Rules for Flipping the Decision Tree:
// 	- The original root node becomes the new rightmost node.
// 	- The original left child becomes the new root node.
// 	- The original right child becomes the new left child.
// This transformation is applied level by level recursively.

// Note:
// ------
// - Each node in the given tree has either 0 or 2 children.
// - Every right node in the tree has a left sibling sharing the same parent.
// - Every right node has no further children (i.e., they are leaf nodes).

// Your task is to help VishnuVardan flip the Decision Tree while following 
// the given transformation rules.

// Input Format:
// -------------
// Space separated integers, nodes of the tree.

// Output Format:
// --------------
// Print the list of nodes of flipped tree as described below.


// Sample Input-1:
// ---------------
// 4 2 3 5 1

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// 5 1 2 3 4


// Sample Input-2:
// ---------------
// 4 2 5

// Sample Output-2:
// ----------------
// 2 5 4
