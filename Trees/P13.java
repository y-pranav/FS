// Balbir Singh is working with networked systems, where servers are connected 
// in a hierarchical structure, represented as a Binary Tree. Each server (node) has 
// a certain processing load (integer value).

// Balbir has been given a critical task: split the network into two balanced 
// sub-networks by removing only one connection (edge). The total processing 
// load in both resulting sub-networks must be equal after the split.

// Network Structure:
// - The network of servers follows a binary tree structure.
// - Each server is represented by an integer value, indicating its processing load.
// - If a server does not exist at a particular position, it is represented as '-1' (NULL).
	
// Help Balbir Singh determine if it is possible to split the network into two equal 
// processing load sub-networks by removing exactly one connection.

// Input Format:
// -------------
// Space separated integers, elements of the tree.

// Output Format:
// --------------
// Print a boolean value.


// Sample Input-1:
// ---------------
// 1 2 3 5 -1 -1 5

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// true


// Sample Input-2:
// ---------------
// 3 2 4 3 2 -1 7

// Sample Output-2:
// ----------------
// false
