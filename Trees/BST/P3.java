// Imagine you are designing a grand castle where each room holds a specific amount 
// of treasure. The castle is built in a binary layout, meaning every room may lead 
// to two adjacent wings—a left wing and a right wing. 

// An "organized section" of the castle follows this rule: for any given room, 
// every room in its left wing contains a treasure value that is strictly less 
// than the current room’s value, and every room in its right wing contains a 
// value that is strictly greater. Additionally, each wing must itself be organized
// according to the same rule.

// Your challenge is to determine the maximum total treasure (i.e., the sum of 
// treasure values) that can be gathered from any such organized section of the castle.

// Example 1:
// input=
// 1 4 3 2 4 2 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 4 6
// output=
// 20

// Castle:
//           1
//         /   \
//        4     3
//       / \   / \
//      2   4 2   5
//               / \
//              4   6

// Explanation: The best organized section starts at the room with a treasure value 
// of 3, yielding a total treasure of 20.

// Example 2:
// input=
// 4 3 -1 1 2
// output=
// 2

// Castle:
//     4
//    /
//   3
//  / \
// 1   2

// Explanation: The optimal organized section is just the single room with a 
// treasure value of 2.

// Example 3:
// input=
// -4 -2 -5
// output=
// 0

// Castle:
//    -4
//   /  \
// -2   -5
 
// Explanation: Since all rooms contain negative treasure values, no beneficial 
// organized section exists, so the maximum total treasure is 0.

// Constraints:

// - The number of rooms in the castle ranges from 1 to 40,000.
// - Each room’s treasure value is an integer between -40,000 and 40,000.
