Imagine you're the chief curator at a renowned museum that houses a rare collection 
of ancient artifacts. These artifacts are arranged in a special display that 
follows a strict rule: any artifact positioned to the left of another has a lower 
value, and any artifact on the right has a higher value. 

Your task is to transform this display into what is known as a "Greater Artifact 
Display." In this new arrangement, each artifactâ€™s new value will be its original 
value plus the sum of the values of all artifacts that are more valuable than it.

Example 1:
----------
input=
4 2 6 1 3 5 7
output=
22 27 13 28 25 18 7

Explanation:
Input structure 
       4
      / \
     2   6
    / \ / \
   1  3 5  7

Output structure:
        22
      /   \
     27   13
    / \   / \
   28 25 18  7

Reverse updates:
- Artifact 7: 7
- Artifact 6: 6 + 7 = 13
- Artifact 5: 5 + 13 = 18
- Artifact 4: 4 + 18 = 22
- Artifact 3: 3 + 22 = 25
- Artifact 2: 2 + 25 = 27
- Artifact 1: 1 + 27 = 28
