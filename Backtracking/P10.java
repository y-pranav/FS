/*
In a forgotten realm, explorers often find ancient treasure maps written as 
long strings of mysterious characters with no spaces. Luckily, they also carry 
an ancient wordbook (pathBook) containing all the known names of places, 
landmarks, and directions.

Your task is to help the explorer decode the map by inserting spaces such that 
each segment is a valid location or direction from the pathBook. Return all 
possible ways to break the map string into a valid sequence of known locations.

You can reuse entries from the pathBook as many times as needed.

Example 1:
----------
input:
deserttemplegolds			//Trasure map
desert temple gold golds	//pathBook

output:
[desert temple gold]

Explanation: The map can be decoded directly into three known places.

Example 2:
----------
input:
forestforesthill
forest hill

output:
[forest forest hill]

Explanation: The explorer can reuse 'forest' more than once.

Example 3:
----------
input:
oceanmountaintemple
mountain temple

output:
[]

Explanation: The map begins with 'ocean', which is missing from the pathBook, so no decoding is possible.


Map Decoding Constraints:
- 1 <= map.length <= 20
- 1 <= pathBook.length <= 1000
- 1 <= pathBook[i].length <= 10
- All strings consist of lowercase English letters.
- All entries in pathBook are unique.
- Input is structured so the total number of valid decoded strings does not exceed 10^5.
