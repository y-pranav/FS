# 🤖 Agentic HR Assistant with MongoDB + OpenAI + FAISS¶
# You are tasked with building an agentic AI assistant for HR policies using the following tools: 🧠 OpenAI gpt-4o for answering policy questions. 📄 FAISS vector store for storing and retrieving HR policy text. 🛠️ MongoDB tools to interact with employee records. 🤖 LangChain agent to orchestrate reasoning and tool selection.
# Part 1: Create the HR Policy Vector Store¶
# Use the provided HR policy paragraph (in-memory, no file I/O).
# Chunk the document using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
# Embed it using OpenAIEmbeddings.
# Store in a FAISS vectorstore (in-memory, no save_local()).

# # 🧾 HR policy as a string (no file I/O)

# At ABC Corporation, full-time employees are entitled to a total of 20 paid leave days per calendar year, including vacation and casual leaves. Sick leave is limited to 10 days annually and must be accompanied by a valid medical certificate for absences longer than two days. Maternity leave of 90 days is granted to female employees, while paternity leave of 15 days is granted to male employees.

# Employees are expected to complete 8 hours of work per day, excluding breaks. Remote work is permitted for up to two days a week, subject to manager approval. All employees undergo a 6-month probation period, during which they are not eligible for certain benefits like work-from-home and insurance. Upon successful completion of probation, they become eligible for health and dental insurance coverage.

# Salary increments and promotions are reviewed annually in January, based on performance metrics defined by team leads. Any HR grievances must be formally submitted through the internal HR portal and are addressed within 14 business days. Contact information such as phone number and address must be kept up to date in the employee portal to ensure timely communication of official notices.

# Termination requires a 30-day notice by either party unless waived by mutual consent. Employees may be placed on performance improvement plans (PIPs) if goals are unmet. Violation of policies, including repeated tardiness or misconduct, may lead to disciplinary action including termination.

# vectorstore=FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
# ✅ Part 2: Implement the Following Tools¶
# Create the following Python functions and wrap them as LangChain tools so that the agent can call them when needed.

# 🔧 Required Tools:¶
# view_remaining_leaves(name: str)

# Retrieves the total remaining paid leaves for the given employee.
# Assume 20 total paid leaves per year.
# Subtract leaves_taken from 20 to return the balance.
# view_salary(name: str)

# Returns the salary history dictionary for the given employee.
# Example output:
# "Salary history for Bob: {'2022': 55000, '2023': 58000, '2024': 61000}"

# from pymongo import MongoClient

# client = MongoClient('mongodb://student:kmit123$@10.11.52.112:27017/admin')
# db = client['hrdb']
# employees = db['employees']
# def view_remaining_leaves(name: str):
#     # YOUR CODE HERE
#     doc = employees.find_one({"name": name})
#     return f"{name} has {20 - doc['leaves_taken']} remaining paid leaves."

# def view_salary(name: str):
#     # YOUR CODE HERE
#     doc = employees.find_one({"name": name})
#     return f"Salary history: {doc.get('salary', {})}" if doc else 'Employee not found.'
# ✅ Part 3: Initialize the LangChain Agent¶
# After creating your tools, configure the AI agent to orchestrate them:

# Use ChatOpenAI with the model "gpt-4o" as your LLM.

# qa_chain using RetrievalQA

# This tool allows the agent to retrieve HR policy details from the FAISS vectorstore.
# The OpenAI LLM for response generation
# Use it to answer natural language policy questions like:
# "What is the sick leave policy?"
# "Can I work from home during probation?"
# Define a tools list with the following:

# All four MongoDB-based tools
# The qa_chain for answering policy questions
# Use initialize_agent() from LangChain:

# Pass the tools list and LLM
# Set agent type to "zero-shot-react-description"
# Set verbose=True to view the agent's reasoning
# In [ ]:
# Student's answer(Top)
# from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
# from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
# from langchain.agents import Tool, initialize_agent

# llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name='gpt-4o')

# # YOUR CODE HERE
# retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
# qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever = retriever) 

# tools = [
#     Tool(name='HRPolicyQA', func=qa_chain.run, description='Answer HR policy questions'),
#     Tool(name='ViewRemainingLeaves', func=view_remaining_leaves, description='Get remaining leaves'),
#     Tool(name='ViewSalary', func=lambda x: view_salary('Bob'), description='Get salary history for Bob')
# ]
# agent = initialize_agent(tools=tools, agent='zero-shot-react-description', llm=llm, verbose=True)
