/*
// Imagine a mystical garden with eight enchanted flower beds arranged in a straight 
// line. In each bed, a magical blossom can either be in full bloom (represented by 1) 
// or remain dormant (represented by 0). 

// Every day, the garden performs its magic ritual: 
// - The state of each blossom is updated based on the state of the two neighboring 
//   flower beds. 
// - Specifically, if both neighbors of a flower bed are either blooming or both 
//   are dormant, then the blossom in that bed will bloom the next day; 
// - otherwise, it will remain dormant. 

// Note that since the garden is arranged in a single row, the first and the last 
// flower beds have only one neighbor each and thus cannot satisfy the two-neighbor
// conditionâ€”they will always become dormant the next day.

// You are provided with an integer array plots of length 8 where plots[i] == 1 
// indicates that the blossom in the ith bed is blooming, and plots[i] == 0 
// means it is dormant. You are also given an integer n which represents the number 
// of days this transformation ritual takes place.

// Your task is to determine the state of the garden after n days of magical 
// transformation.

// Example 1:
// input=
// 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
// 7
// output=
// [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

// Explanation: 
// The garden transforms as follows over 7 days:  
//   - Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  
//   - Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  
//   - Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  
//   - Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
//   - Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
//   - Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
//   - Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  
//   - Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]


// Example 2:
// input=
// 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
// 1000000000
// output=
// [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] 

// Explanation: After one billion days of transformation, the garden settles 
// into the final state [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0].

// Constraints:

// - plots.length == 8  
// - plots[i] is either 0 or 1.  
// - 1 <= n <= 10^9
