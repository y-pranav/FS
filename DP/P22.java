/*
Radhika is leading a disaster response mission and must divide her team’s 
resources into two operational units: Unit Alpha and Unit Beta.

Each resource is represented by a positive integer denoting its capacity score, 
given in the array resources[].

To ensure both units are equally capable, Radhika must split the resources 
into two non-empty ordered groups such that:
	- Every resource is assigned to exactly one unit
	- The sum of capacity scores in both units is at least k

A split is called a valid deployment plan (or great partition) if both groups have 
a total capacity ≥ k. Since the number of deployment plans can be huge, return 
the number of distinct valid deployment plans modulo 10⁹ + 7.

Two plans are considered distinct if at least one resource is assigned to a different unit in each plan.

Input Format
------------
First line: An integer k — the minimum required capacity per unit.
Second line: An integer n — the number of resources.
Third line: n space-separated integers representing resource capacities.

Output Format
---------------
A single integer: the number of valid deployment plans modulo 10⁹ + 7

Constraints
-----------
1 ≤ n, k ≤ 1000
1 ≤ resources[i] ≤ 10

Explanation
------------
These are the valid deployment plans (where each group has sum ≥ 4):
[1, 2, 3] and [4]
[1, 3] and [2, 4]
[1, 4] and [2, 3]
[2, 4] and [1, 3]
[2, 3] and [1, 4]
[4] and [1, 2, 3]
